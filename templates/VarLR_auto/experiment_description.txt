This is an experiment focused on demonstrating the effect of varying learning rates on the convergence and generalization performance of a simple linear model trained on synthetic data. Specifically, the experiment will assess the impact of different learning rates on the training and testing accuracy of a model intended to classify points generated from a multivariate normal distribution, where the labels are determined by the sign of the weighted sum of the input features, imitating a linearly separable dataset.

The core of the experiment will use a dataset generated by the `make_dataset` function, where parameters such as the number of samples, classes, features, and a seed for reproducibility are specified. The experiment will compare the performance of the linear model using a hard-margin support vector classifier (SVM) for initial benchmarking and then train a model using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to minimize the logistic loss, with weights initialized randomly. Key metrics to be evaluated include the training and testing accuracy over epochs, demonstrating how quickly and effectively the model learns the data distribution as the learning rate changes.

To make the comparison fair and insightful, the experiment will be run across several epochs, with accuracy and loss recorded at intervals. Finally, the relationship between the learning rate and model generalization will be analyzed by observing the accuracy trend on separate training and test sets, as well as the evolution of the loss function, providing insight into how different learning rates affect the speed of convergence and the risk of overfitting or underfitting.

Initially, the SVM will serve as a baseline, the performance of which will be compared against the SGD-optimized model across varying learning rates to understand its impact on convergence and generalization. Parameters for the SVM are determined through the `hard_margin.FnormA_du_rmarg` function, while the SGD model's parameters are updated in the training loop via the `train_step` function applying the specified learning rate. Throughout the training process, metrics such as loss and accuracies (on both training and test sets) are captured, along with the Frobenius norm difference between the normalized weight matrices of the SVM and SGD models to measure how the SGD optimization trajectory diverges from the optimal hard-margin separation.
