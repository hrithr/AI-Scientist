This is an experiment from the paper "2411.01350" where we test a simple machine learning model on a classic toy dataset, for instance, MNIST to classify images of digits. We'll use a basic multinomial logistic regression model for this task.

Pseudocode:
1. Load the MNIST dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (normalize, split into train and test sets).
3. Define a logistic regression model using PyTorch (or a relevant library if mandated later).
4. Use cross-entropy loss function and an optimizer (like SGD or Adam).
5. Train the model:
   - Loop over epochs
   - Loop over batches:
     - Compute the predictions
     - Calculate the loss
     - Update the model parameters using backpropagation
6. Evaluate the model on test data to compute accuracy and other relevant metrics.
7. Save performance metrics such as loss and accuracy for each epoch in logs.
