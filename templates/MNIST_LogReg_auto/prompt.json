    "task_description": "The provided Python script implements a simple logistic regression model on the MNIST dataset. It includes functionalities for training, evaluating, and saving model performance metrics in structured JSON files. \n\nFuture research could explore:\n1. Extending the model architecture by adding more layers to create a deep neural network.\n2. Experimenting with different optimizers and learning rate schedules.\n3. Implementing regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization to control overfitting.\n4. Testing the model on different datasets or more complex versions of MNIST like Fashion-MNIST."
